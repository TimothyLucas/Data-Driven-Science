A volcano in Hawaii, threatening to blow its top, has been sputtering lava for a week, and it’s left some devastating results. The Kilauea volcano has forced about 2,000 people to flee and destroyed dozens of homes. Even without an explosion, the damage left behind by lava is substantial in some areas. One Hawaii resident, Warren Fintz, recorded damage in the residential area of Leilani Estates, located in the Island’s Puna region. Magma has been draining out of the volcano’s sinking lava pool and flowing underground eastward before bursting to the surface on Kilauea’s eastern flank in the lower Puna area.
