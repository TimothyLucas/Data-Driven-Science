NEW YORK -- A security guard and an alleged shoplifter were both arrested late Friday after an altercation near a Century 21 department store in Lower Manhatta, CBS New York reports. Witness Brian Fraser says his video shows a man screaming "I can't breathe" while being held down by loss prevention employees at the Century 21 location on Cortlandt Street just before 10:30 p.m. Fraser told CBS New York by phone that one of the security workers even punched the alleged shoplifter at one point. "The security from Century 21 started to choke him, punch him, and hold him down," said Fraser. "You can hear him scream, 'I can't breathe.'" Police reviewed the video, and charged the employee, 24-year-old
