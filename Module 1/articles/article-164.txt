Four men raped and drugged a runaway 15-year-old girl over a four-day period in a San Antonio, Texas, apartment and hotel, court records said. The suspects allegedly kept the teen high on drugs for the duration of her captivity, the San Antonio Express-News reported. Two of the four suspects – Ray Hernandez Jr., 28, and Alfredo Herrera, 25 – were arrested Thursday and booked into Bexar County Jail on human trafficking and sexual assault charges, the Chronicle reported. Hernandez met the teen online before pimping her out to friends and strangers, court records said. One suspect, identified as Korey Acosta, 20, had sex with the girl before working with Hernandez to get her working as a prostitute.
